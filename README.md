# Lydia: Pocket Stylist on the Go

**Lydia** is a personal stylist app that helps users get outfit suggestions based on their body type. No more online shopping disappointment or mall miracle light illusion.  

This app is currently under development as part of my personal journey to learn and build with **React Native** and **Supabase**. I'm building in public, I'm gonna be documenting my process, sharing progress, and pushing through the chaos.
